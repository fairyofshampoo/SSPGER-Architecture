## SSPGER Architecture

### Overview

The SSPGER (Sistema de Seguimiento de Proyecto Guiado y Experiencia Recepcional) repository hosts the architecture and related materials for an innovative web application designed to streamline the management of guided project and reception experience at the Faculty of Statistics and Informatics. This application aims to automate project tracking, artifact delivery, progress monitoring, and reporting processes, benefiting both faculty and students by simplifying and optimizing educational experiences.

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the SSPGER system's architecture, including its components, interactions, and design principles. It serves as a central resource for developers, stakeholders, and contributors involved in the development and maintenance of the SSPGER application.

### Contents

- **Architecture Diagrams:** Detailed diagrams illustrating the system's architecture, including component diagrams, deployment diagrams, and any relevant sequence diagrams.
  
- **Design Documents:** Documents outlining the system's design principles, patterns, and methodologies employed in its development.

- **Requirements Specifications:** Detailed specifications of functional and non-functional requirements gathered for the SSPGER system.

### Vision

The SSPGER project aims to revolutionize the management of guided projects and reception experiences for faculty, students, academic staff, and other stakeholders. By providing an intuitive web application that automates tracking, management, and reporting tasks, SSPGER seeks to enhance participation, improve decision-making, and optimize resource utilization within the educational environment.
